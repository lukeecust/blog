### Notes

*Contingency, Irony, and Solidarity* is, first and foremost, a manifesto of Rorty's neopragmatism. The third part about Nabokov is particularly intriguing.

Pessoa's sensationism needs no further introduction, but I am not one to enjoy carefully reading manifestos within poetry. Some of the critiques, as well as *The Education of the Stoic*, have a nice rhythm to them.

The decadent's home decor manual, *Against Nature*: the neurotic protagonist constructs a world so intricate, with its overwhelming mix of incense, pigments, and shimmering surfaces, that it leaves one feeling dizzy.
