## Hash

### 1. Two Sum: [leetcode.cn/problems/two-sum/](https://leetcode.cn/problems/two-sum/)

Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`.

*   You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution.
*   You may not use the same element twice.
*   You can return the answer in any order.

**Approach and Solution (Hash Map)**

Iterate through the array and use a hash map `map` to store the numbers that have already appeared along with their indices. For the current `num`, check if its complement `target - num` has already appeared: if it has, return the indices of both; otherwise, add the current number to the hash map.

```python
class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
        map = {}  
        for i, num in enumerate(nums):
            x = target - num
            if x in map:
                return [map[x], i]
            map[num] = i
        return []
```

**Complexity Analysis**

*   Time Complexity: `O(n)`, as each element is inserted into the table at most once and looked up at most once (amortized `O(1)`).
*   Space Complexity: `O(n)`, in the worst case, the hash map stores all elements.
