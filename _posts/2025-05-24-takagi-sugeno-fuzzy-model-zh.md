A Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy model is a type of fuzzy model that represents systems effectively, especially for average molecular weights in batch polymerization processes. It offers a simpler and efficient way to model complex chemical reaction processes compared to traditional methods, by utilizing input/output data along with qualitative information.
